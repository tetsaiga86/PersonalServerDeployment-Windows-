# PersonalServerDeployment-Windows

## Introduction:
This is a c# form for deploying an express server over https. It uses node to create a local port and then is forwarded through ngrok. The api is meant to be paired with the android client that can be found here: https://github.com/tetsaiga86/PersonalServer-Android

## Directions For Setup:
The server and client have been set up with the end-user's ease of use in mind.
- Download the latest version, found here: .....
- Unzip to where you would like to install the server
- Install the included node.msi for your system
- Open My Personal Server.exe (found inside the Personal Server server folder)
- Select the directory that will serve as the root of your server
-- Please note that the client will not read hidden directories or files
